*RAM Model* => Single thread infinite memory computing model.

## Interesting Question
**Q**: Is there a set of problems where
verification of the proof cannot be solved in polynomial time.

**A**: No, consider the notion of a proof, it implies there 
shown something, the proof is what is doing the verification.

**Comments**: I found this problem interesting because it
reminds me of orders of derivatives...
